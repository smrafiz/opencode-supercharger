# OpenCode Supercharger

**Security guardrails for OpenCode. Install once, forget forever.**

---

## Why

OpenCode can delete your database, force-push to main, or run a shell script from the internet. Nothing in the default config stops it.

This plugin does.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g opencode-supercharger
npx opencode-supercharger init
```

Or clone and run the install script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smrafiz/opencode-supercharger.git
cd opencode-supercharger
bash install.sh
```

---

## What You Get

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Command blocking** | Stops `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, `curl | bash`, fork bombs before they execute |
| **Git guardrails** | Blocks force-push, `reset --hard`, branch deletion, `stash drop` |
| **Secret detection** | Catches AWS keys, GitHub tokens, API keys in commands and output |
| **Code scanning** | Warns on `eval()`, `innerHTML`, SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, weak crypto |
| **Loop detection** | Warns when the same tool repeats 3x in 30 seconds |
| **Audit trail** | Logs every action to JSONL, auto-redacts secrets, 30-day rotation |
| **Config scan** | Detects prompt injection in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md files |
| **Self-teaching** | Learns from blocked commands and user corrections |
| **Context advisor** | Warns at 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% context usage |
| **Verify on stop** | Warns if files were modified but no tests ran |

---

## What Gets Blocked

- **Destructive**: `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`
- **Pipe-to-shell**: `curl ... | bash`, `wget ... | sh`
- **SQL**: `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`
- **Git**: Force-push, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, branch deletion
- **Credentials**: AWS keys, `ghp_` tokens, `sk-` keys, `PASSWORD=`
- **Clipboard**: `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, `xclip`
- **Sensitive paths**: Keychain, 1Password, `.password-store`
- **Shell history**: `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`
- **Package mismatch**: Running `npm` in a pnpm/yarn/bun project

---

## Code Security Scanner

Scans code before it lands on disk:

| Language | Catches |
|----------|--------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `eval()`, `new Function()`, `.innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| Python | `pickle.load()`, `exec()`, `os.system()`, `subprocess(shell=True)` |
| SQL | f-string SQL, string-concatenated queries |
| All | Hardcoded passwords, API keys, `crypto.createHash('md5')` |

---

## Install Modes

| Mode | Hooks | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Safe** | 8 | Command blocking, code scanner, audit, secret scan |
| **Full** | All | Everything + self-teaching, context advisor, verify-on-stop |

## FAQ

**Will it break my workflow?**
No. It blocks commands that are never part of legitimate AI coding tasks.

**Can the AI disable it?**
No. Writing to `opencode.json` is blocked. The plugin cannot modify itself.

**Where are the logs?**
`~/.config/opencode/supercharger/audit/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
